- Kotlin allows one main function per-class

- There are specific functions (such as `println()` that are imported by default (in this case, from 'kotlin.io')
- Otherwise, imports work the same as Java, but with the added functionality of a named import:

`import com.thisscriptedlife.lighthouse.utils.someUtility as JoesUtils`
